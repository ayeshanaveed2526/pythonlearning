#tupples are immutable, like strings. we use lists if we want mutable sequences.
# What is a Tuple in Python?
# A tuple is an ordered collection of items, just like a list.
# Immutable â†’ once created, you cannot change, add, or remove elements.
# Written using parentheses ( ) instead of [ ].
numbers=(1,5,4,3,2,5,5,4,3,6,3,6,3,0)
print(type(numbers))
print(numbers)
#for empty tuple
a=(1,)
print(type(a))
print(a)
#we cant change tuple because they are immutable and they cannot be modified after creation.

#write a program to store 7 fruits in a list entered by the user
# fruits=[]
# fruit1=input("Enter fruit 1: ")
# fruit2=input("Enter fruit 2: ")
# fruit3=input("Enter fruit 3: ")
# fruit4=input("Enter fruit 4: ")
# fruit5=input("Enter fruit 5: ")
# fruit6=input("Enter fruit 6: ")
# fruit7=input("Enter fruit 7: ")
# fruits.append(fruit1)
# fruits.append(fruit2)
# fruits.append(fruit3)
# fruits.append(fruit4)
# fruits.append(fruit5)
# fruits.append(fruit6)
# fruits.append(fruit7)
# print(fruits)
